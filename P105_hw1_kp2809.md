## Problem 1

This problem focuses the use of inline R code, plotting, and the
behavior of ggplot for variables of different types.

Load the penguin dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
               
penguins
```

Write a short description of the penguins dataset (not the penguins_raw
dataset) using inline R code.

The penguins dataset is a tibble of dimensions of 334 rows and 8
columns. Each row entry is an entry for a single penguin. Each column
describes the species type, island, bill lengths, and depth, flipper
length, body mass, sex, and year that data was taken. Intially, the
columns which are considered factor variables are species, island, and
sex. Columns which are considered double are bill length and bill depth.
Only the body mass, year variables are considered integers. The mean
flipper length can be calculated by using the mean() function in R.
Initially this will return “NA” since there are likely some missing
values in the column, so they need to be dropped in the calculation.

``` r
attach(penguins)
mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 200.9152

The average length of flippers for this sample of penguins is 200.9152
mm.

Make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x); color
points using the species variable (adding color = … inside of aes in
your ggplot code should help).

``` r
scatter= ggplot(data= penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color="red" ))+ 
  geom_point()
scatter
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

This plot shows the relationship between variables Bill and Flipper
length in units mm. There appears to be an upward trend in flipper
length as bill length increases. This shows a strong positive
relationship with few outliers.

Export your first scatterplot to your project directory using ggsave

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot.png", plot = scatter)
```

## Problem 2

Create a data frame comprised of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
df= tibble(
  x= rnorm(10),
  positive= ifelse(x > 0,TRUE, FALSE), 
  char_vec= c("red","red","red","red","blue","blue","blue","orange","orange","orange"),
  fac_vec= as.factor(char_vec)
  
    
)
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##          x positive char_vec fac_vec
    ##      <dbl> <lgl>    <chr>    <fct>  
    ##  1 -1.61   FALSE    red      red    
    ##  2  1.24   TRUE     red      red    
    ##  3  0.831  TRUE     red      red    
    ##  4  0.710  TRUE     red      red    
    ##  5 -0.0127 FALSE    blue     blue   
    ##  6 -0.671  FALSE    blue     blue   
    ##  7  0.881  TRUE     blue     blue   
    ##  8 -0.119  FALSE    orange   orange 
    ##  9 -0.614  FALSE    orange   orange 
    ## 10  0.519  TRUE     orange   orange

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and
what doesn’t?

Hint: to take the mean of a variable in a dataframe, you need to pull
the variable out of the dataframe. Try loading the tidyverse and using
the pull function.

``` r
mean(pull(df, var=x))
```

    ## [1] 0.11582

``` r
mean(pull(df, var=positive))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(df, var=char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, var = char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df, var=fac_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, var = fac_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean of variables x and positive, which is the logical vectors or
TRUE and FALSE return an average, but the character and factor vectors
return NA. We are unable to take an average of a character vector or
factor since they are categorical variables without numerical values. R
treated the logical vector as 0 and 1’s, so it was able to calculate the
average.

In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to
another.Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the
logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not
the output).

``` r
df= 
  df= tibble(
  x= rnorm(10),
  positive= as.numeric(ifelse(x > 0,TRUE, FALSE)), 
  char_vec= as.numeric(c("red","red","red","red","blue","blue","blue","orange","orange","orange")),
  fac_vec= as.numeric(as.factor(char_vec))
  
    
)
```

    ## Warning in eval_tidy(xs[[j]], mask): NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##          x positive char_vec fac_vec
    ##      <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 -0.122         0       NA      NA
    ##  2 -1.34          0       NA      NA
    ##  3 -1.77          0       NA      NA
    ##  4 -1.39          0       NA      NA
    ##  5  2.04          1       NA      NA
    ##  6 -0.424         0       NA      NA
    ##  7  0.566         1       NA      NA
    ##  8 -0.274         0       NA      NA
    ##  9  0.898         1       NA      NA
    ## 10 -0.0865        0       NA      NA

What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens when you try
to take the mean?

NA’s were produced by this data frame for both the character and factor
vector as they were both categorical values. We are still able to
calculate the mean of posititve which simply assigned a 1 to true and 0
to false. There was not a specified way to convert the character vector
to numeric, so it will still be unable to calculate the mean of
categorical vectors
